Portspoof overview

Short description

	The portspoof program is designed to enhance OS security through emulation of legitimate service signatures on otherwise closed ports. 
	It is meant to be a lightweight, fast, portable and secure addition to the any firewall system or security infrastructure.
	The general goal of the program is to make the port scanning software (Nmap/Unicornscan/etc) process slow  and output very difficult to interpret, 
	thus making the attack reconnaissance phase a challenging and bothersome task.
	 
	 General benefits of using this software are:
	 - Protection against well known port scanners (all scanning results are chaotic and difficult to interpret)
	 - Possibility to use your current firewall rules to decide for which hosts "port spoofing" applies
	 -
